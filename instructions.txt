--The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clear cut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir.
Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study.
You have been asked to build an application that allows Rangers to track wildlife sightings in the area.--

The application must track two categories of wildlife:

class 1 (modal.Animals)
At the very least, require:

int id;
String name;

class 2 (Endangered modal.Animals)
Due to their dwindling numbers, Rangers must record additional information about modal.EndangeredAnimals:

int id;
String name;
String health;

Use constants to define options like "healthy", "ill", and "okay". <FINAL keyword>

1.)  "healthy", "ill", and "okay". <FINAL keyword>
2.)  "newborn", "young", or "adult". <FINAL keyword>


String age (an estimated guess by the ranger);

Use constants to define options like "newborn", "young", or "adult". <FINAL keyword>

Each time an animal species of either category is seen, a modal.Sightings must be reported:

Sightings
When wildlife is spotted, a Ranger submits a form to record a modal.Sightings containing the following:

id of Animal or EndangeredAnimal species
location
(Conveyed in any manner you choose ie: "Zone A", "Near the River", "NE Quadrant", or latitude and longitude values are all acceptable.)
rangerName
Exceptions
It may take a few days for new Rangers to familiarize themselves with the app. To avoid saving incomplete or invalid records, throw and catch exceptions if Rangers attempt to submit an incomplete form, or misuse the application in any other conceivable fashion.

Database Naming Requirements
For this code review, use the following database names:

Production Database: wildlife_tracker
Development Database: wildlife_tracker_test
Table Names:animals, sightings
Setup Instructions
In your README, include detailed setup instructions with all commands necessary to re-create your databases, columns, and tables (example below from To Do):





 <select class="custom-select">
                                        <option selected>Health..</option>
                                        {{#if health }}
                                            {{#each health as |h|}}
                                                <option name="health" id = "health" value={{h}}>{{h}}</option>
                                            {{/each}}
                                        {{/if}}
                                    </select>

  <select class="custom-select" id="age" name="age">
                                        <option selected>Age..</option>
                                        {{#if age }}
                                            {{#each age as |a|}}
                                                <option name="age" id="age" value={{a}}>{{a}}</option>
                                            {{/each}}
                                        {{/if}}
                                    </select>
